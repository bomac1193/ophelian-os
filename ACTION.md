**Last Updated:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Interactive Puzzle System Live, Creation Flow Enhanced, All Emojis Removed

---

## Current State

### ✅ Recently Completed (Tasks #22, #23, #24)

**Progressive Disclosure System - Fully Integrated**
- Three-layer genome display system (Surface → Gateway → Depths)
- Symbol mapping library (∞, ♦, ◊, etc. → Orishas)
- React components:
  - `GenomeDisplay` - Main orchestrator
  - `SymbolicImprint` - L-class + symbols (Surface layer)
  - `GatewayTooltip` - Hover hints (Gateway layer)
  - `AdvancedView` - Full mythology (Depths layer, unlocked after 3 characters)
- **INTEGRATED:** Progressive disclosure now live on imprint pages
  - `/imprint/[id]` - Shows three-layer display with collapsible details
  - `/imprint` - Character cards show symbolic imprints
  - Symbolic imprints visible in Character Oripheon Status section
- Demo page live at `/genome-demo` (localhost:3100)

**Genome Sync System - Fixed and Verified**
- All 14 characters now have genomes (was 12/14 with errors)
- Fixed 'caminos' undefined error (removed invalid Aganjú mapping)
- Created comprehensive `genome-stress-test.sh` script
- `/genomes/sync-all` endpoint working perfectly
- Stress test results: 14/14 characters, 8/8 relics, 0 errors, 9ms response time

**UI Improvements**
- Relics separated from regular characters in dedicated section
- **Removed ALL emojis from interface:**
  - Removed 4 emojis from MultiModalPreview component (🎨, 🎤, 🎵, 💃)
  - Replaced emoji-like Unicode in symbolic primitives:
    - Ọ̀ṣun: '〰️' → '≈' (approximately equal - flow)
    - Èṣù: '⚡' → '×' (multiplication - threshold)
    - Ṣàngó: '♛' → '■' (filled square - sovereignty)
- Symbolic imprints displayed consistently across all character views

**Interactive Puzzle System (New!)**
- Replaced simple expandable with riddle-based authentication for deep genome mysteries
- Dynamic riddles generated from genome properties (Orisha sacred numbers, Sephira names)
- Hint system unlocks after 2 failed attempts
- Smooth animations: fade-in, slide-down, shake on error, shimmer effects
- Gateway hints guide users to discover answers
- Makes knowledge discovery engaging and aligned with mysterious aesthetic

**Enhanced Character Creation Flow (New!)**
- Live symbolic imprint preview during creation
- Real-time updates as users select Orisha/Sephira/Psychology
- Shows Surface layer (L-class + symbol) and Gateway hints immediately
- Auto-generates preview genome when selections change
- Educates users about symbolic meaning while they create

## What Needs to Be Added

### 🎯 High Priority - Polish & Refinement

#### 1. Visual Polish (Partially Complete)
**Goal:** Improve aesthetics and code maintainability

**Completed:**
- ✅ CSS transitions and animations for puzzle unlock
- ✅ Smooth fade-in for details reveal
- ✅ Hover effects and shimmer effects on buttons
- ✅ Shake animation for error states
- ✅ Live preview animations in creation flow
- ✅ Move inline styles to CSS modules
  - GenomeSummaryCard.tsx → GenomeSummaryCard.module.css
  - MultiModalPreview.tsx → MultiModalPreview.module.css
  - 500+ lines of inline styles converted to maintainable CSS

**Remaining:**
- [ ] Add page load animations for symbolic imprints
- [ ] Refine hover states across all components
- [ ] Consider adding sound effects for puzzle unlocks (optional)

#### 2. Additional Riddle Types
**Goal:** Expand puzzle variety

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add more riddle variations for each Orisha
- [ ] Create riddles based on Caminos (paths)
- [ ] Add difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- [ ] Consider adding image-based puzzles for visual learners
- [ ] Track user solve times for analytics

### 🔄 Medium Priority - Feature Enhancements

#### 3. Advanced View Unlock System
**Goal:** Implement progression mechanics for depths layer

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add user progress tracking (character count, account age)
- [ ] Implement unlock notification when user reaches 3 characters
- [ ] Add visual indicator showing progress toward unlock (e.g., "2/3 characters created")
- [ ] Create onboarding tooltip explaining the unlock system
- [ ] Consider gamification elements (badges, achievements)

#### 4. Symbol Library Expansion
**Goal:** Complete the symbol-to-Orisha mapping

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Review and finalize symbol assignments for all Orishas
- [ ] Add alternative symbols for visual variety
- [ ] Create symbol legend/guide in UI
- [ ] Document symbol meanings in user-facing help

#### 5. Gateway Layer Enhancement
**Goal:** Improve tooltip content and interactivity

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write compelling gateway hints for all Orishas
- [ ] Add click-to-expand functionality for longer hints
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation for tooltips
- [ ] A/B test different hint phrasings for curiosity optimization
- [ ] Add analytics to track which hints drive most engagement

### 📚 Low Priority - Documentation & Polish

#### 6. User Documentation
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create user guide for understanding genome displays
- [ ] Add tooltips/help icons throughout the app
- [ ] Write blog post or help article about progressive disclosure system
- [ ] Create video walkthrough for onboarding

#### 7. Developer Experience
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add Storybook stories for genome components
- [ ] Write unit tests for progressive disclosure logic
- [ ] Add visual regression tests for genome displays
- [ ] Document component API and usage patterns

#### 8. Performance Optimization
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Lazy load `AdvancedView` component
- [ ] Optimize re-renders in `GenomeDisplay`
- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton screens
- [ ] Implement caching for genome data

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

#### 9. Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
- **Comparative View:** Side-by-side genome comparison
- **Evolution Timeline:** Show how genome changes over character development
- **Social Sharing:** Generate shareable genome cards
- **Customization:** Allow users to choose preferred symbol sets
- **Interactive Mythology:** Click Sephira/Orisha for deep-dive articles
- **Genome Analytics:** Show rarity/uniqueness metrics

#### 10. Strategic Positioning
- **Market Differentiation:** Emphasize "accessible yet deep" positioning
- **Content Marketing:** Publish articles about progressive disclosure UX
- **Community Building:** Create Discord/forum for deep lore discussions
- **Partnerships:** Explore collaborations with spiritual/gaming communities

## Immediate Next Steps

### Recommended Order:
1. ✅ **Test the demo page** (`/genome-demo`) - COMPLETED: Demo page working
2. ✅ **Integrate into character detail page** - COMPLETED: Added to `/imprint/[id]` overview tab
3. ✅ **Update character cards** - COMPLETED: Added ImprintBadge to GenomeSummaryCard
4. **Implement unlock tracking** to complete the progression loop - IN PROGRESS
5. **Polish and optimize** based on user feedback

### Quick Wins:
- ✅ Add `GenomeDisplay` to one existing page (character detail) - DONE
- Write 5-10 compelling gateway hints - TODO
- Create CSS module to replace inline styles - TODO
- Add simple fade-in animations for layer reveals - TODO

---

## Technical Debt to Address

- **Inline Styles:** Move to CSS modules or styled-components
- **Type Safety:** Ensure all genome data properly typed
- **Error Handling:** Add fallbacks for missing/malformed data
- **Accessibility:** Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Testing:** Add unit tests for progressive disclosure functions

---

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement:
- % of users who hover over symbols (gateway engagement)
- % of users who unlock advanced view
- Time spent viewing genome displays
- Character creation completion rate

### Business Goals:
- User retention after seeing advanced view
- Community discussion about lore/mythology
- Differentiation from competitors (qualitative feedback)

## Notes

- Progressive disclosure system is ready for production use
- All code committed to `main` branch (commit: 59f2712)
- Documentation comprehensive and up-to-date
- System is designed to scale with additional Orishas/features

**Key Insight:** This system allows Bóveda to be both accessible (Surface layer) AND deeply engaging (Depths layer) - a true blue ocean position that competitors can't easily replicate.
