# Typography Rules

## The One Rule That Ends All Debate

**If the text must be interpreted → Fraunces is forbidden.**
**If the text must be obeyed or understood → Söhne only.**

---

## 1. Primary Headings (H1–H3)

**Font:** Fraunces

**Role:** Presence · Naming · Orientation

These introduce spaces, sections, or states.

### Use Fraunces when the text:

- Names a page or section
- Establishes context
- Sets tone before content
- Should be felt before read

### Examples:

- THRESHOLD
- Trajectories
- Sources
- Rights & Ledger

### Rules

- Short (1–6 words ideally)
- No paragraphs
- No explanation
- No all caps
- Regular / Semibold only

> Fraunces announces — it never explains.

---

## 2. Secondary Headings / Subheadings (H4–H6)

**Font:** Söhne (Halbfett or Medium)

These are structural labels, not expressive moments.

### Use Söhne when the text:

- Explains how something works
- Introduces a block of information
- Groups content
- Functions as UI guidance

### Examples:

- How Access Works
- The Agreement
- The Return
- Available Sources
- Revenue Distribution

### Why NOT Fraunces here

- These are operational, not ceremonial
- Using Fraunces would aestheticise procedure
- That's where mystique sneaks back in

### Rules

- Sentence case
- Clear, literal language
- Slightly tighter line-height than body
- Medium / Halbfett only

> Think of these as signposts inside the vault.

---

## 3. Body Text / UI Text

**Font:** Söhne (Buch)

This is law, clarity, and trust.

### Use for:

- Paragraphs
- Explanations
- Descriptions
- Legal text
- Buttons
- Filters
- Metadata

**No exceptions.**

## Visual Summary (Mental Model)

| Font | Question it answers |
|------|---------------------|
| Fraunces | "Where am I?" |
| Söhne Halbfett | "What is this part?" |
| Söhne Buch | "What does it do?" |

If you apply this consistently, the site will feel calm, inevitable, and serious.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Using Fraunces for:

- Feature descriptions
- Philosophy text
- Ethical claims
- Long statements

*That turns feeling into authority.*

### ❌ Using Söhne Buch for:

- Page titles
- Major section names

*That flattens identity.*

### ❌ Mixing Fraunces and Söhne within the same heading

*This creates uncertainty about authority.*

## Final Lock

| Element | Font |
|---------|------|
| Big headings (H1-H3) | Fraunces |
| Subheadings (H4-H6) | Söhne Medium / Halbfett |
| Body / UI | Söhne Buch |

This hierarchy:

- Preserves your manifesto
- Protects against mysticism
- Keeps authority structural
- Works across music, fashion, and tech

**You can now design without second-guessing.**
