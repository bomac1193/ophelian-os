# Glyph Iterations

## Overview

Developing a custom symbol system for THE TWELVE through syncretic fusion:

**African Diasporic Traditions** + **Quantum Mathematics** + **Computer Science** + **Primitive Symbols** + **Sacred Geometry**

A post-colonial visual language that bridges ancestral knowledge with computational futures.

---

## Design Philosophy

### The Fusion Principle

Each glyph fuses elements from multiple traditions to create something new:

```
[African Form] + [Quantum/CS Logic] + [Sacred Structure] = Bóveda Glyph
```

The result should feel:
- Ancient yet futuristic
- Organic yet computational
- Spiritual yet technical
- Immediately recognizable yet mysteriously deep

---

## Visual Sources

### African Diasporic Traditions

#### Adinkra (Akan/Ghana)
- Ideographic symbols encoding proverbs and concepts
- Bold, geometric, high contrast
- Each symbol carries philosophical weight

#### Veves (Haitian Vodou)
- Ritual drawings invoking Lwa/spirits
- Intricate linework, symmetrical, often radial
- Cosmograms mapping spiritual geography

#### Nsibidi (Nigeria)
- Ideographic writing system (Ekoi/Ejagham peoples)
- Abstract, gestural, historically secretive
- Encodes concepts, narratives, relationships

#### Ron Eglash Fractals
- Self-similar patterns in African architecture, textiles, braiding
- Recursive structures encoding hierarchies
- Scaling patterns that work at multiple sizes

### Aesthetic Requirements
- Cohesive family — recognizable as THE TWELVE
- Distinct from each other at small sizes
- Encode meaning through form
- Work with brutalist minimal aesthetic
- No gradients, single stroke weight
- Feel both ancient and computational

### Fusion Requirements
- Each glyph must contain at least 3 source traditions
- African element must be structurally primary
- Quantum/CS elements should feel integrated, not decorative
- Sacred geometry provides underlying structure
- Primitive symbols anchor recognition at small sizes

### Cultural Considerations
- Honor source traditions without appropriation
- Create new forms inspired by, not copied from
- Document influences transparently
- System is syncretic by design
- Acknowledge the post-colonial reclamation of symbol-making

## Implementation Notes

### File Structure
```
/public/glyphs/
  anvil.svg
  schism.svg
  keth.svg
  omen.svg
  strata.svg
  cull.svg
  silt.svg
  toll.svg
  limn.svg
  vault.svg
  wick.svg
  void.svg
```

### Component Updates Needed
- `SymbolicImprint.tsx` — render SVG instead of text character
- `SymbolLegend.tsx` — display new glyphs
- `symbol-mapping.ts` — update symbol type to reference SVG paths

### Potential Animation States
- Idle: static SVG
- Hover: subtle pulse or glow
- Active: element separation/revelation
- Transition: morph between states
